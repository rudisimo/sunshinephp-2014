## Development, By The Numbers

> By [Anthony Ferrara][1]

### Code Quality

* The central enemy of reliability is complexity.
* Cyclomatic Complexity
  * Single Method: 11+ (Very High)
  * Average Per Method: 6+ (Very High)
  * Average Per Line of Code: 15+ (Very High)
* N-Path Complexity
  * Single Method: 1025+ (Very High)
  * Average Per Method: 
  * Average Per Line of Code: 
* N-Path helps identify how many Unit Tests should be written.
* Change Risk Analysis Procedure (C.R.A.P.)
* Tools
  * PHPLOC: Summarizes an entire codebase
  * PDepend: Lower Level analysis
  * PHPMD: Finds messy code
  * Jenkins: Continuous integration
  * Sonar: Like Jenkins (with a tighter integration)
* [Splunk][6]: Helps you understand your data
* No one tool has the answer to everything, together they help paint the bigger picture. Make your decisions based on that.
